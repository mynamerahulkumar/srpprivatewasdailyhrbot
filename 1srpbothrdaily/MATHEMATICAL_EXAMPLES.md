## 🎯 Basic Breakout Calculations

### Example 1: Simple Breakout Level Calculation

**Given:**
- Previous 4-hour period OHLC data:
  - Open: $60,000
  - High: $65,000
  - Low: $58,000
  - Close: $62,000

**Calculate Breakout Levels:**
```
Previous_High = $65,000
Previous_Low = $58,000
Range = $65,000 - $58,000 = $7,000
```

**Order Placement:**
```
Buy_Order_Price = $65,000 (triggers on bullish breakout)
Sell_Order_Price = $58,000 (triggers on bearish breakout)
```

**Current Price Analysis:**
```
Current_Price = $62,000
Distance_to_High = $65,000 - $62,000 = $3,000
Distance_to_Low = $62,000 - $58,000 = $4,000
```

**Result:** Price is closer to high, suggesting potential bullish bias.

### Example 2: Multi-Period Level Calculation

**Given:** 3 previous 4-hour periods
```
Period 1: High = $64,000, Low = $59,000
Period 2: High = $66,000, Low = $61,000  
Period 3: High = $65,500, Low = $60,500
```

**Calculate Reference Levels:**
```
Previous_High = max($64,000, $66,000, $65,500) = $66,000
Previous_Low = min($59,000, $61,000, $60,500) = $59,000
```

**Range Analysis:**
```
Total_Range = $66,000 - $59,000 = $7,000
Average_Range = $7,000 ÷ 3 = $2,333
Volatility = Standard_Deviation(Highs) = $1,000
```

### Example 3: Timeframe Comparison

**Daily Timeframe (1D):**
```
Previous_Day_High = $67,000
Previous_Day_Low = $59,000
Daily_Range = $8,000
```

**4-Hour Timeframe (4H):**
```
Previous_4H_High = $65,000
Previous_4H_Low = $61,000
4H_Range = $4,000
```

**Analysis:**
```
Daily_Range_Percentage = $8,000 ÷ $63,000 = 12.7%
4H_Range_Percentage = $4,000 ÷ $63,000 = 6.3%
Ratio = Daily_Range ÷ 4H_Range = 2.0
```

**Conclusion:** Daily timeframe has 2x the range, indicating higher volatility.

## 🛡️ Risk Management Mathematics

### Example 1: Stop Loss and Take Profit Calculation

**Given:**
- Entry Price: $65,000
- Stop Loss Points: 1,000
- Take Profit Points: 2,000

**For Long Position:**
```
Stop_Loss_Price = $65,000 - $1,000 = $64,000
Take_Profit_Price = $65,000 + $2,000 = $67,000
Risk_Amount = $1,000
Reward_Amount = $2,000
Risk_Reward_Ratio = $2,000 ÷ $1,000 = 2:1
```

**For Short Position:**
```
Stop_Loss_Price = $65,000 + $1,000 = $66,000
Take_Profit_Price = $65,000 - $2,000 = $63,000
Risk_Amount = $1,000
Reward_Amount = $2,000
Risk_Reward_Ratio = $2,000 ÷ $1,000 = 2:1
```

### Example 2: Risk-Reward Analysis

**Scenario:** Multiple trade outcomes
```
Trade 1: Win $2,000 (Risk: $1,000)
Trade 2: Loss $1,000 (Risk: $1,000)
Trade 3: Win $2,000 (Risk: $1,000)
Trade 4: Loss $1,000 (Risk: $1,000)
Trade 5: Win $2,000 (Risk: $1,000)
```

**Calculations:**
```
Total_Wins = 3 × $2,000 = $6,000
Total_Losses = 2 × $1,000 = $2,000
Net_Profit = $6,000 - $2,000 = $4,000
Win_Rate = 3 ÷ 5 = 60%
Average_Win = $6,000 ÷ 3 = $2,000
Average_Loss = $2,000 ÷ 2 = $1,000
Profit_Factor = $6,000 ÷ $2,000 = 3.0
```

### Example 3: Breakeven Probability

**Formula:**
```
Breakeven_Probability = 1 ÷ (1 + Risk_Reward_Ratio)
```

**Given Risk-Reward Ratios:**
```
1:1 Ratio: Breakeven_Probability = 1 ÷ (1 + 1) = 50%
2:1 Ratio: Breakeven_Probability = 1 ÷ (1 + 2) = 33.33%
3:1 Ratio: Breakeven_Probability = 1 ÷ (1 + 3) = 25%
```

**Interpretation:**
- 1:1 ratio requires 50% win rate to break even
- 2:1 ratio requires 33.33% win rate to break even
- 3:1 ratio requires 25% win rate to break even

## 💰 Position Sizing Formulas

### Example 1: Fixed Risk Position Sizing

**Given:**
- Account Balance: $10,000
- Risk per Trade: 2%
- Stop Loss: 1,000 points
- Contract Value: $1 per point

**Calculation:**
```
Max_Risk_Amount = $10,000 × 0.02 = $200
Position_Size = $200 ÷ 1,000 points = 0.2 contracts
```

**Practical Application:**
- Round down to 0 contracts (too small)
- Or increase risk to 5%: $500 ÷ 1,000 = 0.5 contracts

### Example 2: Kelly Criterion Position Sizing

**Formula:**
```
f = (bp - q) ÷ b
```

**Where:**
- f = Fraction of capital to bet
- b = Odds received (Risk-Reward ratio)
- p = Probability of winning
- q = Probability of losing (1-p)

**Example:**
```
Win_Rate = 60% (p = 0.6)
Risk_Reward = 2:1 (b = 2)
Loss_Rate = 40% (q = 0.4)

f = (2 × 0.6 - 0.4) ÷ 2
f = (1.2 - 0.4) ÷ 2
f = 0.8 ÷ 2 = 0.4 (40% of capital)
```

**Position Size:**
```
Position_Value = $10,000 × 0.4 = $4,000
```

### Example 3: Volatility-Based Position Sizing

**Given:**
- Account Balance: $10,000
- Target Risk: 1% of account
- ATR (Average True Range): 500 points
- Contract Value: $1 per point

**Calculation:**
```
Target_Risk_Amount = $10,000 × 0.01 = $100
Position_Size = $100 ÷ 500 points = 0.2 contracts
```

**With 2x ATR Stop Loss:**
```
Stop_Loss_Points = 500 × 2 = 1,000 points
Position_Size = $100 ÷ 1,000 points = 0.1 contracts
```

## 🎯 Breakeven Logic Mathematics

### Example 1: Basic Breakeven Calculation

**Given:**
- Entry Price: $65,000
- Current Price: $66,500
- Breakeven Trigger: 1,000 points

**Step 1: Calculate Profit**
```
Profit = $66,500 - $65,000 = $1,500
```

**Step 2: Check Breakeven Trigger**
```
Profit ($1,500) >= Breakeven_Trigger ($1,000) ✓
```

**Step 3: Move Stop Loss**
```
Old_Stop_Loss = $64,000
New_Stop_Loss = $65,000 (Entry Price)
```

**Result:** Position is now risk-free!

### Example 2: Progressive Breakeven

**Given:**
- Entry Price: $65,000
- Initial Stop Loss: $64,000
- Breakeven Trigger: 500 points
- Progressive Trigger: 1,000 points

**Price Movement:**
```
Price reaches $65,500:
  Profit = $65,500 - $65,000 = $500
  Profit >= 500 points ✓
  Move SL to $65,000 (Breakeven)

Price reaches $66,000:
  Profit = $66,000 - $65,000 = $1,000
  Profit >= 1,000 points ✓
  Move SL to $65,500 (Lock in $500 profit)
```

### Example 3: Trailing Stop Loss

**Given:**
- Entry Price: $65,000
- Trailing Distance: 500 points
- Current Price: $67,000

**Calculation:**
```
Trailing_Stop = Current_Price - Trailing_Distance
Trailing_Stop = $67,000 - $500 = $66,500
```

**Price Movement Tracking:**
```
Price $65,000 → $66,000: Trailing_Stop = $65,500
Price $66,000 → $67,000: Trailing_Stop = $66,500
Price $67,000 → $66,500: Stop Loss Hit (Profit: $1,500)
```

## 📈 Performance Metrics

### Example 1: Basic Performance Calculation

**Given Trading Results:**
```
Trade 1: +$2,000
Trade 2: -$1,000
Trade 3: +$1,500
Trade 4: -$500
Trade 5: +$3,000
```

**Calculations:**
```
Total_Trades = 5
Winning_Trades = 3
Losing_Trades = 2
Total_Profit = $2,000 + $1,500 + $3,000 = $6,500
Total_Loss = $1,000 + $500 = $1,500
Net_Profit = $6,500 - $1,500 = $5,000
Win_Rate = 3 ÷ 5 = 60%
Average_Win = $6,500 ÷ 3 = $2,167
Average_Loss = $1,500 ÷ 2 = $750
Profit_Factor = $6,500 ÷ $1,500 = 4.33
```

### Example 2: Sharpe Ratio Calculation

**Given:**
- Average Return: 2% per month
- Risk-Free Rate: 0.5% per month
- Standard Deviation: 3% per month

**Calculation:**
```
Sharpe_Ratio = (Average_Return - Risk_Free_Rate) ÷ Standard_Deviation
Sharpe_Ratio = (2% - 0.5%) ÷ 3%
Sharpe_Ratio = 1.5% ÷ 3% = 0.5
```

**Interpretation:**
- Sharpe Ratio > 1: Excellent
- Sharpe Ratio 0.5-1: Good
- Sharpe Ratio < 0.5: Poor

### Example 3: Maximum Drawdown

**Given Portfolio Values:**
```
Day 1: $10,000
Day 2: $10,500
Day 3: $9,800
Day 4: $11,200
Day 5: $10,900
Day 6: $9,500
Day 7: $10,300
```

**Calculation:**
```
Peak_Value = $11,200 (Day 4)
Trough_Value = $9,500 (Day 6)
Max_Drawdown = $11,200 - $9,500 = $1,700
Max_Drawdown_Percentage = $1,700 ÷ $11,200 = 15.18%
```

## 🧮 Advanced Mathematical Concepts

### Example 1: Monte Carlo Simulation

**Simulation Parameters:**
- Win Rate: 60%
- Risk-Reward: 2:1
- Number of Trades: 100
- Simulations: 1,000

**Python Code Example:**
```python
import numpy as np

def monte_carlo_simulation(win_rate, risk_reward, num_trades, simulations):
    results = []
    
    for _ in range(simulations):
        portfolio_value = 10000
        for _ in range(num_trades):
            if np.random.random() < win_rate:
                portfolio_value += 2000  # Win
            else:
                portfolio_value -= 1000  # Loss
        
        results.append(portfolio_value)
    
    return results

# Run simulation
results = monte_carlo_simulation(0.6, 2, 100, 1000)
print(f"Average Final Value: ${np.mean(results):,.2f}")
print(f"95% Confidence Interval: ${np.percentile(results, 2.5):,.2f} - ${np.percentile(results, 97.5):,.2f}")
```

### Example 2: Value at Risk (VaR) Calculation

**Given:**
- Portfolio Value: $10,000
- Daily Returns: [-2%, +1%, -3%, +2%, -1%, +1%, -2%, +3%, -1%, +2%]
- Confidence Level: 95%

**Calculation:**
```
Sorted_Returns = [-3%, -2%, -2%, -1%, -1%, +1%, +1%, +2%, +2%, +3%]
VaR_95 = -2% (5th percentile)
VaR_Amount = $10,000 × 0.02 = $200
```

**Interpretation:** 95% confidence that daily loss won't exceed $200.

### Example 3: Correlation Analysis

**Given Two Assets:**
```
Asset A Returns: [1%, 2%, -1%, 3%, 0%]
Asset B Returns: [2%, 1%, -2%, 4%, -1%]
```

**Calculation:**
```
Mean_A = (1 + 2 - 1 + 3 + 0) ÷ 5 = 1%
Mean_B = (2 + 1 - 2 + 4 - 1) ÷ 5 = 0.8%

Covariance = Σ((A_i - Mean_A) × (B_i - Mean_B)) ÷ (n-1)
Correlation = Covariance ÷ (StdDev_A × StdDev_B)
```

R_Squared = 0.85 (strong correlation)
```

**Prediction:**
```
If VIX = 40:
  Predicted_Return = 5.75 - 0.25 × 40 = -4.25%
```

### Example 3: Hypothesis Testing

**Null Hypothesis:** Win rate = 50%
**Alternative Hypothesis:** Win rate > 50%
**Sample Size:** 100 trades
**Observed Win Rate:** 60%

**Z-Score Calculation:**
```
Z = (0.6 - 0.5) ÷ √(0.5 × 0.5 ÷ 100)
Z = 0.1 ÷ 0.05 = 2.0
```

**P-Value:** 0.023 (significant at 5% level)
**Conclusion:** Reject null hypothesis, win rate is significantly > 50%
